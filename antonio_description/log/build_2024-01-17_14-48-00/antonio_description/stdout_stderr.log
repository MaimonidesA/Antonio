[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrplidar_ros2.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "rplidar_ros2", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "rplidar_ros2" with
  any of the following names:

    rplidar_ros2Config.cmake
    rplidar_ros2-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "rplidar_ros2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "rplidar_ros2_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "rplidar_ros2" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
